# Why it's x
Published on: 2025-10-22

Welcome to to my *new blog*!
For now, there's just this single post to test things,
but I do plan to post about thoughts and stories as well.
Enjoy this pointless argument for now!

1. **It just is.**
Whyâ€”you might ask? Don't ask.
Just *accept* the truth and move on.

2. **Why wouldn't it be?**
Can you make a single argument on why it's not?
... You can't.
Therefore it is.

3. **Can it be y?**
If you really think about it...
While it's *theoretically* possible,
it's practically not.
(It's astronomically unlikely.)
So it's most likely x.
